Accuracy: (TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN) - out all of the predictions, how many were correct?
Recall: TP/(TP+FN) - of all the cases that are positive, how many did the model identify?
Precision: TP/(TP+FP) - of all the cases that the model predicted to be positive, how many actually are positive?
F1-Score: An average metric that takes both precision and recall into account.
Support: How many instances of this class are there in the test dataset?



Multiclass classification
One vs Rest (OVR), in which a classifier is created for each possible class value, with a positive outcome for cases where the prediction is this class, and negative predictions for cases where the prediction is any other class. For example, a classification problem with four possible shape classes (square, circle, triangle, hexagon) would require four classifiers that predict:
square or not
circle or not
triangle or not
hexagon or not
One vs One (OVO), in which a classifier for each possible pair of classes is created. The classification problem with four shape classes would require the following binary classifiers:
square or circle
square or triangle
square or hexagon
circle or triangle
circle or hexagon
triangle or hexagon
